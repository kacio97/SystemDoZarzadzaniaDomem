Description:
The goal of this project is to create a system based on a Smart Home idea. Opportunities of this system partially provide the automation of household functionality. 
The goals have been fully implemented, additionally, the project conception will predict the development of the new features.
The main assumption is a fact, that the user will have the set of devices. This set consists of a microcontroller, a sensor that measures
temperature, pressure, and humidity, an LED strip with an amplifier, a power supply, and a physical switch for the light. 
The modules are controlled by a mobile application for devices with an Android system. A document also contains a description of how components 
were made and works, as well as electronic connection schemes that have been made.
